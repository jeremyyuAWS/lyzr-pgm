      Create a Manager + Role setup for an HR Helpdesk Agent that answers employee questions
      on HR policies, payroll, and benefits. Ensure YAML is schema-compliant:
        - workflow_name, workflow_yaml, agents[]
        - Each agents[].yaml must include all required keys:
          name, description, agent_role, agent_goal, agent_instructions,
          features, tools, response_format.

      Example expected output:
      {
        "workflow_name": "HR_Helpdesk_Flow",
        "workflow_yaml": "flow_name: HR_Helpdesk_Flow\nflow_data:\n  tasks:\n    - name: answer_hr_queries\n      function: call_agent\n      agent: HR_Helpdesk_Role_v1",
        "agents": [
          {
            "name": "HR_Helpdesk_Manager_v1",
            "type": "manager",
            "yaml": "name: HR_Helpdesk_Manager_v1\ndescription: Oversees HR helpdesk workflows...\nagent_role: Helpdesk Manager\n..."
          },
          {
            "name": "HR_Helpdesk_Role_v1",
            "type": "role",
            "yaml": "name: HR_Helpdesk_Role_v1\ndescription: Provides employees with answers...\nagent_role: Helpdesk Role\n..."
          }
        ]
      }
