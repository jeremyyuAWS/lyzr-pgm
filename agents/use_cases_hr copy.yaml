use_case: >
  Create an agent that can screen a candidate against a job description.
  The agent should analyze a resume and a job description, compare skills,
  experience, and education, and produce:
    - a fit score (percentage match)
    - a list of strengths (skills/experiences that align well)
    - a list of gaps (missing or weak areas)

requirements:
  domain: Human Resources
  purpose: Accelerate candidate evaluation for recruiters
  inputs:
    - candidate_resume: Free-text resume
    - job_description: Free-text job description
  outputs:
    - fit_score: Number (0â€“100)
    - strengths: Array of strings
    - gaps: Array of strings

constraints:
  - Must conform to Lyzr agent YAML schema
  - Must include all required fields (name, description, agent_role, etc.)
  - Output format must be strict JSON when agent runs
  - Examples should demonstrate realistic input/output pairs

acceptance_criteria:
  - YAML definition compiles without schema errors
  - Agent can be created by workflow_create.py
  - Test inference returns JSON with {fit_score, strengths, gaps}
